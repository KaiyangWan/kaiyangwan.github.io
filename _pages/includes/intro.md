Hi! I am a CS PhD student at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">KAUST</a> beginning from 2021. My supervisor is Prof. <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/xiangliang-zhang/"> Xiangliang Zhang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao/">Xin Gao</a>. 
Prior to KAUST, I got my B.S degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn//">Wuhan University</a> supervised by  Prof. <a href="http://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/">Qian Wang</a>  and my M.S degree in <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/en/">Dongyan Zhao</a>.

I have a wide-ranging interest in research topics related to natural language processing and text generation. 
My specific focus is on enhancing the performance of text generation, particularly in terms of accuracy, robustness, explainability, and trustworthiness. 
This includes applications in summarization, response generation, and question answering, among others. 
Additionally, I am keen on applying NLP for social good, such as using large language models (LLMs) to expedite scientific discovery and improve healthcare applications, and using LLM as agents for computational social science.
I have published more than 30 papers at the top international AI conferences.  If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at [xiuying.chen@kaust.edu.sa](mailto:xiuying.chen@kaust.edu.sa).

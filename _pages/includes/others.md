This homepage is a space for reflection and renewal—a place where I face the gaps and uncertainties in my academic journey and turn them into fuel for growth. Here, I see the uncharted paths that lie ahead and remind myself to keep moving forward, guided by curiosity and ambition. I believe research is a journey of discovery and impact—a way to push boundaries and shape a future where technology serves humanity. My goal is to develop trustworthy AI that upholds transparency, fairness, and ethics, enhancing social productivity to combat poverty, prejudice, and injustice, and contribute to a more prosperous and equitable world.
